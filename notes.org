* set up detection of quiet moments in the audio files via segmentation so we can initialize filter
* explore noise reduction repo and determine how to get uniform vector lengths for fft
* some audio files gives errors, figure out how to take filter of all audio files



* remember to change server model 
* write client post to server with audiodata
* npm build to github pages
* (very maybe) add a cute animation to the webapp using anime
